FC analysis: models resting-state FC to predict inter-individual differences in motor tasks, selecting a specific band, network and task.

FC analysis_DAN_MN: models resting-state FC to predict inter-individual differences in motor tasks, considering the interaction between DAN and MN.

IDrate_vs_nodes: further analysis to investigate if the IDrate is independent of the number of nodes in the network.

performance_vs_size: further analysis to investigate the behaviour of the performance metrics with respect to the size of the dataset.

EMG analysis:
processing_EMG: pre-processing of EMG signals.

clean_EMG: remove bad segments from EMG signals.

analysisMEG_EMG_RMS/ZCR: models resting-state FC to predict inter individual differences in RMS and ZCR extracted from EMG data during motor tasks.

analysisMEG_EMG_RMS/ZCRntw: models resting-state FC to	predict inter individual differences in RMS and ZCR exploiting 3 graph metrics extracted from FC matrices.

taskFC_RMS/ZCR: models task-evoked FC to predict inter individual differences in RMS and ZCR extracted from EMG data during motor tasks.
