Master's thesis: Modelling MEG-based resting-state functional connectivity to predict inter-individual differences in motor tasks.

This study is a contribution to the ERC HANDmade project (SH4,ERC-
2017-STG) directed by Prof. Betti (University "LaSapienza" of Rome),
which investigates how natural hand usage shapes behaviour as well as 
intrinsic and task-evoked brain activity. In particular, the thesis work
aims at modelling magnetoencephalography-based resting-state functional 
connectivity to predict inter-individual differences in motor tasks.
It also investigates the possibility of finding a relationship between 
functional connectivity data at rest and muscular activation.
Results indicate that individual differences in task-evoked functional
connectivity can be related to individual differences in spontaneous 
cortical activity (at rest), but the same cannot be assessed
with muscle activation. This could be due to the simplicity of the model or
the features used to represent the data. Therefore, further tests should be
done in the future to overcome these limitations and open novel opportunities
for future developments of robotic-assisted technology and neuroprostheses,
based on personalized educational training programs.
