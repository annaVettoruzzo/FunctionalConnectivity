processing_EMG: pre-processing of EMG signals.

clean_EMG: remove bad segments from EMG signals.

analysisMEG_EMG_RMS/ZCR: models resting-state FC to predict inter individual differences in RMS and ZCR extracted from EMG data during motor tasks.

analysisMEG_EMG_RMS/ZCRntw: models resting-state FC to	predict inter individual differences in RMS and ZCR exploiting 3 grah metrics extracted from FC matrices.

taskFC_RMS/ZCR: models task-evoked FC to predict inter individual differences in RMS and ZCR extracted from EMG data during motor tasks.
